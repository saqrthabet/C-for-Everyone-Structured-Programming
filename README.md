## Week 2 Assignment: Using struct (Option1-General)

A user data type using (enumerated types) are created to support date struct that has month and day. Then a function is established to produce a next day.  So nextday (date) of December 12 is December 13. In addition to a function printdate(date) that prints a date legibly. The function can assume that February has 28 days and it must know how many days are in each month.

## Week 2 Honor assignment: Evaluate different Card probabilities
A struct is used to define a card as an enumerated member that is its suit and rank. Next, the cards have to be randomly shuffled. Then after dealing out 7 card hands, evaluate the probability that a hand has no pair, one pair, two pair, three of a kind, full house and 4 of a kind.  The Monte Carlo method was used to get an approximation to these probabilities.  

## Week 3 Assignment: Singly Linked List (Option1-General)
A singly linked list is used to store a randomly generated set of 100 integers. Then the list's elements where the interger numbers are stored are to be rearrange in a sorted order of according to the integer values. Bubble sort was used and eventually these values are printed in rows of 5.

## Week 3 Honor assignment: Double Linked List (Eliminating all duplicated data)

The singly linked list is modified to a doubly linked list. Then 200 random integer numbers are generated in the range [0,49]. After linking the list's elements. The listâ€™s elements are first sorted and then adjacent elements of the sorted list with the same value are removed. The resultant list will be sorted and has no repeated elements.

## Week 4 Assignment: Arrays

An input text file with a group of integers has to be opened and read, then an array has to be created based on these integers, where the first integer dictate the size of the array and number of integers to be read in to an array called data[]. Then these elements in the array has to be processed to compute their average as double and their maximum value as int. Then all the output result have to be shown on screen and printed in a file named answer-hw3.

## Week 4 Honor: Binary Tree

An input text file with a group of integers has to be opened and read, then an array has to be created based on these integers, where the first integer dictate the size of the array and number of integers to be read in to an array called data[]. An algorithm has to be designed to places these values into a binary tree structure, afterwards, print the binary tree content by walking the tree "inorder".
