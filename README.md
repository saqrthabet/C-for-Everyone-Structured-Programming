## Week 2 assignment: Using struct (Option1-General)

A user data type using (enumerated types) are created to support date struct that has month and day. Then a function is established to produce a next day.  So nextday (date) of December 12 is December 13. In addition to a function printdate(date) that prints a date legibly. The function can assume that February has 28 days and it must know how many days are in each month.

## Week 2 Honor assignment: Evaluate different Card probabilities
A struct is used to define a card as an enumerated member that is its suit and rank. Next, the cards have to be randomly shuffled. Then after dealing out 7 card hands, evaluate the probability that a hand has no pair, one pair, two pair, three of a kind, full house and 4 of a kind.  The Monte Carlo method was used to get an approximation to these probabilities.  

## Week 3 assignment: Singly Linked List (Option1-General)
A singly linked list is used to store a randomly generated set of 100 integers. Then the list's elements where the interger numbers are stored are to be rearrange in a sorted order of according to the integer values. Bubble sort was used and eventually these values are printed in rows of 5.

## Week 3 Honor assignment: Double Linked List (Eliminating all duplicated data)

The singly linked list is modified to a doubly linked list. Then 200 random integer numbers are generated in the range [0,49]. After linking the list's elements. The listâ€™s elements are first sorted and then adjacent elements of the sorted list with the same value are removed. The resultant list will be sorted and has no repeated elements.
