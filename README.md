## Week 2 Assignment: Using struct (Option1-General)

A user data type using (enumerated type) is created to support date struct that has month and day. Then, a function is established to produce the next day. So nextday(date) of December 12 is December 13. Moreover, a printdate(date) function is written to print a date legibly. The function can assume that February has 28 days, and it must know how many days are in each month.

## Week 2 Honor assignment: Evaluate different Card probabilities

A struct is used to define a card as an enumerated member that is its suit and rank. Next, the cards have to be randomly shuffled. Then, after dealing out 7 card hands, it evaluates the probability that a hand has no pair, one pair, two pair, three of a kind, full house, and 4 of a kind. The Monte Carlo method was used to get an approximation of these probabilities.  

## Week 3 Assignment: Singly Linked List (Option1-General)

A singly linked list is used to store a randomly generated set of 100 integers. Then, the list's elements where the integer numbers are stored are to be rearranged in a sorted order according to the integer values. Bubble sort was used, and eventually, these values were printed in rows of 5.

## Week 3 Honor assignment: Double Linked List (Eliminating all duplicated data)

The singly linked list is modified to a doubly linked list. Then, 200 random integer numbers are generated in the range [0,49]. After linking the list's elements, they are first sorted, and then adjacent elements of the sorted list with the same value are removed. The resultant list will be sorted and have no repeated elements.

## Week 4 Assignment: Arrays

An input text file with a group of integers has to be opened and read. Then, an array has to be created based on these integers, where the first integer dictates the size of the array and the number of integers to be read into an array called data[]. Then, these array elements must be processed to compute their average as double and their maximum value as int. Finally, all the output result has to be shown on the screen and printed in a file named answer-hw3.

## Week 4 Honor: Binary Tree

An input text file with a group of integers has to be opened and read. Then, an array has to be created based on these integers, where the first integer dictates the array size and number of integers to be read into an array called data[]. An algorithm has to be designed to place these values into a binary tree structure, and then, it prints the binary tree content by walking the tree "inorder".
